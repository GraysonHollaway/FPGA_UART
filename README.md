#FPGA UART Implementation 
##115200 Baud rate; 8-bit; No parity; 1 stop bit; No flow control

This is an implementation of UART in verilog. This project is sythesizable and place and routable on a GoBoard FPGA from nandland.com

Using a terminal to interface with the FPGA, the two 7-segment displays the ascii code of each key press.
